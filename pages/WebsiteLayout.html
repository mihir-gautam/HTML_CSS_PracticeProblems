                            and the leaves fell early that year and we saw the troops marching along the road 
                            and the dust rising and leaves, stirred by the breeze, falling and the soldiers 
                            marching and afterward the road bare and white except for the leaves.

                            <p> In the shadow under the green visor of 
                                the cap Ignatius J. Reilly’s supercilious blue and yellow eyes looked down upon 
                                the other people waiting under the clock at the D.H. Holmes department store, 
                                studying the crowd of people for signs of bad taste in dress. Several of the outfits, 
                                Ignatius noticed, were new enough and expensive enough to be properly considered 
                                offenses against taste and decency. Possession of anything new or expensive only 
                                reflected a person’s lack of theology and geometry; it could even cast doubts upon 
                                one’s soul.</p>

                            <p> I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an 
                                upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from 
                                deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people’s hats off — 
                                then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute 
                                for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; 
                                I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, 
                                almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same 
                                feelings towards the ocean with me.</p>
